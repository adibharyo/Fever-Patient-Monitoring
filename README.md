# Touchless-Thermometer-MLX90614
The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has led to limited interaction and contact among humans. One of the main symptoms experienced by patients infected for the first time is high fever. The Fever Patient Monitoring System is a fever patient monitoring system that uses the ESP32 microcontroller for data processing and communication. The ESP32 will be connected to a temperature sensor used to detect the patient's body temperature. Additionally, the ESP32 will be connected to a web server that serves to notify the patient's condition when the fever is high. The sensors used include the MLX90614 temperature sensor and an IR obstacle sensor for object detection.
